# Advent of Code - 2020

## About

In an effort to teach myself Clojure, I am working through the Advent of Code 2020 examples. There are 25 days in the 'Advent Calendar', and each 'day' gives two problems. You need to complete the first problem to access the second one meaning the first part of the solution was created before I knew how (or if) it could be used in the second part. 

I am trying to write each solution in a fairly functional style which means (to me):

- As few non-pure functions as possible.
- Defering side effects until the last possible responsible moment.
- Concentrating side effects (so its easy to see them all at once).

Note: you need to create an account on Advent of Code to see the problems, so I tried to give a brief description of the problem in the code.
